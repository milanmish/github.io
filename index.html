Mr. Forepaugh was into the dry good's business, so when his fortune was made, he bought this beautiful mansion. He also decided to hire himself some servants to accompany his new found wealth. Well, Mr. Forepaugh became rather fond of one of his servants in particular. Her name was Molly, and the two of them soon began to have a steamy love affair together. However, things got rather ugly after Mrs. Forepaugh caught the two together in the midst of their lovemaking. She insisted Mr. Forepaugh break off the affair, and so he did. This did not settle well with Molly, who was now pregnant with Mr. Forepaugh's child. She became so distraught over the situation that she went to the third floor, tied a noose around herself and a light fixture, then threw herself out of the window. Mr. Forepaugh was so devastated over her death that he went into a deep depression and eventually shot himself at the nearby railroad tracks. It is said that Mr. Forepaugh and Molly now haunt the mansion. People have claimed to see Molly near the area where she hanged herself. Mr. Forepaugh, on the other hand, has been seen by employees and customers in the dining room area. They say that a nice looking guy just walks through the dining room as if he owns the place.</div>`)[0];

It was closed as a hospital sometime in the 70's and reopened as a nursing home in the late 80's/early 90's. The story is that an off duty policeman who was working as a security guard was shot and killed as he was getting off the elevator in the basement, which is where the morgue was located. There are four elevators in the building, but if you get on that particular elevator, no matter what direction it is going or what floor you push, it will go straight to the basement, open, and then close again before going to where it's directed. The employee break room is in the basement but is rarely used, as you have to walk past the old morgue to get to it and there are strange noises there at night. There was also a tunnel from the basement leading to the old nurse's dormitory, which was once used for storage. The maintenance men disliked using it because they reported hearing strange noise and lights flickering off and on. The property sits across the street from a group of Indian burial mounds.</div>`)[0];

Returning home from the casino (on Hwy 18 along the Mississippi river) alone after midnight, a witness reports he stopped his car on the shoulder of the highway to take a little nap as it was late and he was tired. Shortly after he closed his eyes, he heard the soft muted sound of footsteps walking towards his car. The footsteps sounded like a person with a broken leg because it was dragging one leg as it walked. He got up to see who it was because he didn't want the cops to give him a ticket. He peered out of the car window to see an old man(?) with dark hallow eyes and frayed white hair leaning on the passenger window behind the driver's seat. The old man was rotten and his clothes were tattered! That was all he could make out of the ghost before he quickly started his car and drove off in a hurry.</div>`)[0];

The Southern Building is the oldest jail in Minnesota, made with true 2" x 4" boards stacked flat instead of stud walls of today, has original outside wrought iron bar doors & windows (early 1900's it was turned into living quarters for guest). The Northern Building is the Main Inn with three floors.  The first floor (Addressed as "The Tunnel") was a funeral home when first opened in the early 1800's. Then the first floor was turned into a haberdashery, and later during the Bootleg Era, the back room opened up to a tunnel that went through a hill to the old trail for distribution (part of the tunnel is used inside, and another section can be seen in the side of the hill to this day).  The second floor used to be the living quarters and was used to prepare bodies for the funeral home in the early 1800's (old photos show a sliding door on the North Side where bodies were brought in for preparation, renovation with window is now in that location, but the original wood floor unloading area is still there today - different from the rest of the wood floor on the second floor), later 1800's to be turned into living quarters for guests. The third floor was an old stable added on the second floor in the late 1800's and renovated for guest living quarters.</div>`)[0];

As far as the history of the building, the basement, where the restroom is, used to be a jail during the earlier duration of Cornell's existace. The entire building has a heavy sort of a feeling to it, but it is the basement in particular that makes all who step down there to visit the restroom uneasy. Some librarians working there would not go down to the basement to the restroom the entire time they worked there because of the uncomfortable feeling that overwhelms visitors to the basement. The entire basement area has had virtually no remodeling and is for lack of better description "rugged". To my knowledge there has been no sightings of any kind, just the feeling of an overbearing presence of some kind.</div>`)[0];

The story is that a car full of football players were going to their game and their car stalled on this very hill. So they all got out and started to push the car up this hill then a car came around this bend and didn?t see the football players and hit them. All of the players died. People say that if you put your car in neutral between these 2 markers you will go uphill because the football players push you up the hill because they don?t want you to get hit by another car. Another story is that two children who lived in the nearby mansion were playing in the road when they were run over and killed. When your car moves, it is the children pushing it off of them. Anyway, the going up hill sensation is caused by an optical illusion. For this to work, you must be headed downhill. In the place where you stop, the road levels off and appears to go up in comparison to the rest of the road. If you go down the hill and around the curve and look back, you will realize that the entire road does indeed go down hill.</div>`)[0];

Some nights you can drive by it and see shadows, and lights going on and off in the windows. An old lady gives tours there in the summer and says that it could be haunted by the founders of Humboldt County or by the famous wrestler Gotch. - December 2003 update/addition: The submitter to the addition has heard of a fisherman walking around there, possibly he is there because the Des Moines river is right next to the museum and there is a story of a fisherman drowning to death there many years ago. Another story that is true is that if you walk up to the front sign of the museum and ask it any question it will move to the right-meaning yes or it will move to the left-meaning no. please note it is a hanging sign on hinges. Some people might think it is the wind doing this but it only happens on calm nights when there is no wind or gusts at all. There is a lot of history at the museum.</div>`)[0];

Students in this residential hall have reported strange noises, cold spots, and movement of objects. Lawther Hall has always been a women's dorm, and at no time was it ever used as an infirmary. During the war it was used partially as a dormitory for WAVES- definitely not men. In fact, the stories told of Augie center largely around the fifth (or perhaps fourth) floor attic areas. These were never used as rooms, but were originally recreational areas for the women in the dorm. In the early 70's, these rooms were closed (1972, I believe) because they were deemed in disrepair and quite unsafe. For a few years, a hall Halloween Haunted House called "Augie's Attic" was held there until a fire started accidentally one year, and the activity was banned. In fact, to say that Lawther is the dorm that is primarily haunted could be entirely incorrect. Next door to Lawther, in fact attached to, is Bartlett Hall. Bartlett has an identical layout, and though is now coed, was once all female as well. To suggest that the two have been confused is not unlikely.</div>`)[0];

It was once the ancient burial ground of the local Indian tribe. When the settlers came, they dug the Indians' graves and placed them in five mounds throughout the hilltop. In retaliation, the Indians killed a white woman names Mrs. Henry Lott. She was the first white woman killed in Webster County. She was buried there. Over fifty small children are buried there along with many soldiers. If you go there at night, you can hear children laughing and the sound of Indians. If you roll down the hill three times, you will see the stairway to heaven. Also, legend has it if you desecrate and Indian mound, you will be cursed. I have known two men to have done so, and they were involved in serious car accidents within a week of visiting the cemetery. An interesting link is Spirit Lake Massacre of 1857, not sure of the validity of the story in the link, though. There is a large monument to her there, presumably above her grave.</div>`)[0];

With two other men, he built the Rock Garden Tavern in 1936, which he ultimately managed after his retirement from lumber jacking in 1949. In 1950 this self-taught sculptor began crafting his unique entourage of cowboys, miners, Indians, and soldiers. Indian. His first masterpiece was inspired by the image of a large antlered deer leaping over a log that he had noticed on a boy's sweater. He used beer bottles from his tavern to decorate the life-size concrete horde, which mostly crowds the front of the park along Hwy. 13. He built the broad-shouldered, blocky characters starting with wooden frames wrapped with mink wire, or animal skeletons.</div>`)[0];

People around here say that it's Kate forever reliving the incident that saved a train and lots of people. - September 2004 CORRECTION: located west of the City of Boone, is not the bridge where Kate Shelley saved the passenger train. It was actually first structured in early 1900's and was named "The Boone Viaduct". It was renamed for Kate Shelley in the 1960's. The bridge has wonderful tales of "Specter" Steam Engines and ghostly "watchmen" that walk it. The original bridge that Kate Shelley crossed was demolished in the 1930's. Kate Shelley's ghost, accordingly, haunts the hamlet of Moingona, Iowa, South West of City of Boone, where the story took place.</div>`)[0];

Also will venture into other rooms and play pranks, especially with electrical equipment. - *Note: There is a false rumor around the college that she was a student and jumped out the window of 305, or that she lived in 305 and jumped off Smith Hall, but this has no historical backing and all of the people who have see talked to her have nothing from the conversations to support this.</div>`)[0];

Many people have gone into this empty building and came out with sever mental disorders. The building is no longer standing but you can still see people that used to live there. - This was listed as "Thief River Falls - The Old Insane Asylum"-  There never was an insane asylum in Thief River Falls. However, a resident of the town for many years, knows the building that is being referred to. It was formerly located in Oakland Park, the three-story brick building built in the late 1800s was a sanitarium for tuberculosis patients. It served that purpose until TB was eradicated in the 1950s. After that, the building was used as a nursing home until a new nursing home was built on the property in the late 70s early 80s. In the mid-1980s the building housed a dormitory for the local community college. The students that lived there were a little upset when the college failed to mention that the "dorm" was about six miles away from the college. Needless to say, the building was only used for a few years as a dorm. It stood empty from that time and was used for storage for the nursing home. It was torn down a few years ago. There is some interesting features on the building and its history. A tunnel was constructed that lead from the basement kitchen to the nurses' quarters (a separate building on the premises) so that the staff could travel between the buildings without having to go outside in the winter.</div>`)[0];

Rumor has it that on occasion a nun would become pregnant, with the pregnancy resulting in mis-carriage. These babies were buried in unmarked graves on the Monastery grounds, where the mall stands today. My grandfather used to drive an ice cream truck, and would deliver to the Monastery, and witnessed one of the nuns nursing (feeding) an infant in the kitchen of the Monastery. In present day, the Merle Hay Tower is said to be haunted by a figure wearing a very old style habit, who cries as she carries a dead child. People who have offices in the Tower report an elevator that moves between floors with no one aboard late at night. When the elevator stops, footsteps can be heard, but when the sounds are investigated, no one is around. Cold spots are frequent and a feeling of being watched when alone is also reported. Others report hearing someone walk into an office and when they turn around, no one is there.</div>`)[0];

Some time later his daughter Jenny, for whom the settlement was named for died. On how she died is speculation. One account says she fell in love with one of the lumberman, became pregnant and killed herself. Another is, she died during child birth. Another is she died from flu brought by the white man. The chief buried her on the hill, and cursed the ground that it would never do any white man any good. The curse is the legend. Nine people died after T.B. Scott bought the land for a home in 1884 and died unexpectedly in 1886 before the house was finished. Within a year his wife Ann died. Their son Walter went to see the architect to finish the house. He was stabbed to death by him. In 1893 it was sold to a man named Kuechle. He lost all his money on a gold mine and mortgaged the house to Tony Barsanti. Tony foreclosed and Kuechle went insane and died in an asylum. The same year Barsanti was stabbed to death in Chicago while waiting for a train to Merrill. In 1901, George Gibson bought the house and went to inspect it. He was never seen again. In 1906, Mary Fellhaber bought the property. Soon after fell ill and died. Popcorn Dan was the caretaker and died in 1912 after booking passage on the Titanic.The next caretaker Mr. Lloydsen died of alcoholism. In 1919 the widower of M. Fellhaber gave the property to the city. In 1923 the city gave it to the Sisters of the Holy Cross who have seemed to break the curse for now. Rumors of ghost sightings in the tower.</div>`)[0];

It is known that the farmer went crazy when he found out that the wife was pregnant, so he drowned her in the lake, and the farmer was never seen again. Recently, two counselors from the campsite went to check on a missing camper out in the woods at night, and ran into what was an extremely bright light where they describe that they "couldn't see a thing." They said they had no choice, but to turn around because the light was blinding, and as they turned around they saw a woman run away from them. The counselors start running in a different direction...a direction that lead to the only tent on the campsite, but when they started running for the tent, they realized they couldn't find it. So, they both turned around to look and see where exactly they were when they noticed that the tent was in fact right behind them...the weird thing about this is, is that in order to end up in front of the tent, you have to cross a road, which the counselors themselves told me they "Never, ever crossed." One counselor said "We were running and running as fast as we could, and then we found ourselves in front of the tent which is impossible unless you cross the road...which we did not." Strange indeed, and it has been told that investigators had found the pregnant farmer's wife in the lake, and buried her underneath the campground. Still today, the lady remains underneath the site in body, but in soul she remains on earth. Watch out carefully for her as you visit this site.</div>`)[0];

It is said she committed suicide by hanging herself on old heating pipes in the rooms. Residents of her room have reported recently of hearing a girls voice and gagging choking sounds at night while they're studying. They've opened up their doors and yelled down the halls at their hall mates thinking it was a joke and no one was out there and the sounds continued. Other girls of the hall reported seeing a moderately dressed young woman walking slowly down the hall sniffling and crying and walking through the door into the haunted room.</div>`)[0];

Upon starting the older employees would always talk of "Rodriguez". He was one of 2 resident ghosts in the building. There was actually a building electrician that died in the late 50's by the name of Rodriguez. In those days they had to manually lubricate high-powered electrical connections before they would have a show. Rodriguez as the building electrician was responsible for this. One day before a show he turned of the power to the electrical junction so he could perform his duty. He told another employee that he would be done in 10 minutes and that the other employee could then turn the power back one. Well the other employee waited the 10 minutes and turned on the power. 2 hours later Rodriguez wife showed up with a new suit for him because it was his birthday. They searched the building and found him dead by the electrical box electrocuted. He haunts the building to this day with flickering lights and lights turning on when they?re not supposed to as well as just a general coldness in the area of his death. The other ghost is that of a 12-year-old boy. He and his friend in the early 60's climbed up on the roof of the building to hunt pigeons. He became separated from his friend and his friend left thinking he was gone already. The missing child was not found for 2 weeks until a foul smell was detected at the bottom a roof exhaust that was meant for a boiler that was never installed. The total fall was over 150 feet, And the shaft was hastily completed with many sharp edges and exposed rebar jutting into it. It was not a pretty sight. He frequents the roof doors and the bottom of the shaft. When you enter the roof you can hear screams, as you get closer to the area of the fall. The bottom of the shaft is gone now but still it is very cold in the general area and even through the banter of the HVAC system you can hear faint crying.</div>`)[0];

Some report that both sensations get stronger as they approach a gravestone with a tree growing out of it- half of the tree is dead, half of it still produces green leaves every year. - June 2008 Correction: The Headstone with the tree is wrong. It is an actual tree made into a headstone. It is cut off of an old hanging tree. It is cut from the part down from where they used to hang people from it. The rope is still attached to the tree and the headstone is actually carved into the tree. It is in the older top part of the cemetery, along the dirt cut through.</div>`)[0];

Eventually some people cut off her hand so that she wouldn't be able to hurt anyone anymore, but at night time her hand was still there, glowing in the night holding the rose that she might drop on you. When approaching the angel you will see the sky turn blood red and when you look at the trees cause the angel is set back all by itself in a cove, the short side of the trees will be swaying and the tall side will not. - March 2007 Background Information: The Blue Angel is made of an ebony white gypsum. In the sides of the mausoleum in which she is housed are two cobalt blue stained glass windows. One to the east and one to the west. Each morning as the new dawn emerges and each night as the day ends the sun shines thru the windows bathing her in a luminescent glow turning her white figure blue. During the 50's stories of the blue angel were all of a benevolent nature. She was the protector, the guardian angel of the cemetery, protecting all within from any vandals or wrong doers. It is very sad the current stories of any evil associated with her.</div>`)[0];

In the gymnasium an electrician was working on an air-conditioning unit that was located under the bleachers when he happened to look up and he saw a hooded figure float from one wall to another through a solid brick wall on both sides. A young lady was working at night cleaning on the third floor for two nights. And for two nights she saw a girl come out of a closed door in the hall and go right through a picture of Mary on the opposite side.

Also, cold spots have been felt by visitors along the viewing hill. Every clear night on this road all you have to do is look for parked cars. Over the next hill as soon as the sun goes down you will see a red orb hovering in the air. After a few seconds it will turn white and disappear. This has gone on every night for many years. A lot of speculation has gone on but with no definite answers. One story is the light is from the lantern of a railroad switchman who fell asleep on duty and was killed, but there are many more.</div>`)[0];

There were Offices and group rooms in the ward to the west of ours and the ward to the east was "empty". When they first started working that unit quite a few of the coworkers asked them things like, ?aren't you afraid to work on that unit its so creepy up there and have you ever seen anything up there.? Not understanding their questions until one night when a terrible racket began on the empty unit. The only way it can be described is the sound of heavy metal furniture being dragged across the floor and slammed into the connecting door and wall. It shook the walls and actually woke up the patients on a few occasions. When it was searched the "empty" unit was always empty and looked like nobody had been in there for years.

The Villa was a Catholic School. The legend has it that the priests would have intercourse with the nuns, then when the nuns were pregnant, they would physically take the baby out of the womb and burry them into the walls. If you go there at night, you can here the aborted babies knocking on the walls, trying to get out. Toilets flushing for no apparent reason, footsteps, and women screaming.

While late one night after high school prom a young couple was down there and the goatman killed them and the couch was covered with thier remains.

The farmer who was driving the plow reported seeing another boy. The farmer stated the only description he could give of the second boy was, he was wearing a red t-shirt, blue jeans, and had dark brown hair and was around the age of eight. When the neighbors of the deceased boy who resided at Milan Manor Apartments were questioned they reported seeing him last with a young unknown boy fitting the farmers description. There were no reports of the boy in the red t-shirt being seen until 1989. There have been numerous reports of two boys playing in the woods together around dusk. Upon hearing this story a couple of explorers decided to check it out. They took a trip to Milan Manor Apartments parked in the parking lot found a trail that lead into the woods located past the cul-de-sac (circle). They followed the winding trail to a little stream, crossed the stream walking over a piece of lumber, took the path leading to the right, then they came to a fork in the path & decided to take the left path up a hill after we reached the top of the hill we stopped to catch their breath before continuing. As they caught their breath they saw two little boys, one of which was wearing a red t-shirt running into the cornfield as they entered the corn field they vanished. Unable to believe what they had just seen they walked toward the cornfield and was unable to find even a footprint but could still hear the laughter of the boys.</div>`)[0];

In the daytime, there is a tree that contains an evil face. But at night, the spirits frequently make themselves known. It is not the cemetery but it is the woods that surrounds the cemetery that is haunted. Apparently about fifty to a hundred years ago, a small cult came the cemetery and did ceremonies. Now whenever you drive at night into the cemetery, you may enter but you may not be able to get out. The reason for this is because there is a glowing object in the woods and if this glowing object gets too close to you, you will not be able to start your car. But in order to witness the strange happenings you need to have your car turned off and lights turned off. You can have a flashlight with you but that is it. While you are in complete silence and complete darkness, something might run passed you several times and when you look nothing will be there. Sometimes you might hear moaning in the woods, sometimes you will hear what sounds like somebody pounding a metal sheet against a tree. Sometimes you will see a dark figure staring at you from a tree. And if you are really lucky, you will witness the strangest and scariest experience that you ever had. At times you might wait for a good five or ten minutes and nothing will seem to happen, but when you have given up all hope and decide to leave, all at once there will sound like a herd of elephants are all around you and make the loudest racket. You are guaranteed to jump in your car and take off, but that is just the beginning. If you leave your window open, while your driving, you will hear the object following you until you have reached the end of the pathway leading to the cemetery. Also the weather is completely different there, it could be a hot day and when you reach the cemetery, it will be cold. And it could be the clearest day and when you reach the cemetery it will begin to rain. And there could be no wind at all and when you reach the cemetery there will be ten to twenty mile an hour winds. - Fair WARNING ? As with all other haunted places, you need to get permission before going in to a cemetery late at night. There may be NO TRESPASSING and you could be fined. Be smart and be safe, do it the legal way.</div>`)[0];

The background of this park is very macabre to begin with. In the early 1900's, Lynch mobs would ride through town and hang or otherwise mutilate any black people that happened to be in sight. They hung so many black people that the trees still bow over the road leading to Hummel Park. The weird part is that young trees and even the grass lean toward the road outside the park and even inside the park. Apparitions, mists, Indian drums playing at night, wolves howling. Supposed old Indian burial grounds on sight. Also, reports of the morphing stairs. It is a staircase which is roughly 200 stairs long. The word, "roughly" is used because every time you go up and or down it you will count a different number of stairs. There is a staircase at Hummel Park that if you walk up to the top and count the stairs going up, it will be less than the number of stairs going down, it is called the stairway to hell because of this. There have been many reports of animal sacrificing in the park. There is also a cult of albinos that live in the park, supposedly. But be careful of crazy people out there if you decide to go. - October 2007 Update: Parts of the steps are missing and falling apart so your count will always be different. Be careful.</div>`)[0];

The ghost's name is Gus. About 20-25 years ago there was a tornado drill. So everyone had to go to the "Catacombs" as we call them. This was a part of the building that was built when the performing arts part of the building was built. It was the 50's so it was built, to be a nuclear fallout shelter. Well during this tornado drill everyone went down to the catacombs. Gus, a janitor for the Performing Arts part of the building, thought that they would be there for a while. So he went to the "Rat Room" to get some provisions for everyone. He closed the door behind him, went to get a barrel of food, when it fell on him, and crushed his head. He was not found until he had been dead for a while. Now Gus still roams the Performing Arts section of the building, even after it was remolded about 10 years ago. The strange thing is that if you are in a play there and you don't believe in Gus he will mess you up. As in you mess up your lines, cues, entrances, etc. He also likes to be in the Green Room, which is right next to the Catacombs; he leaves lights on and open doors.</div>`)[0];

It is believed that a double murder/suicide took place somewhere in the upstairs stockroom. Apparently, a couple worked together for Zody's and the boyfriend caught his girlfriend in a compromising situation with another male employee. The enraged boyfriend located a box cutter and slashed the two to death. He then slashed his own wrists and carotid artery. After several reports from employees of unusual activity, Kmart headquarters in Michigan has admitted to hiring paranormal/paraphysical investigators to conduct investigations into the incident. The conclusion was that indeed the building was occupied by several spirits. The investigators concluded that four different spirits dwell throughout the building. The fourth has not been linked to any known incident that may have occurred and thus is unknown for its presence. Kmart has remained quiet on the findings of this investigation and resources revealed that employees of this store are not advised of this activity. Prior to changing over to Kmart, Zody's employees reported seeing a man walking about in the stockroom. A woman is also seen running and sometimes screams are heard. In one case, an overnight employee sustained a 7 inch laceration while working in the stockroom. Zody's management insisted that the incident was just an accident caused by falling boxes that were stacked too high, but resources close to the victim tell another tale. A paring knife mysteriously came across the room and cut the employee across the chest. No one was seen in the area. The victim survived his wounds, but obviously resigned from the company. Sightings and sounds have been reported throughout the years, but no one else has been physically attacked since.</div>`)[0];

Most of the stones date back to the early 1800's. There is an Indian buried there who was killed by the people trying to settle in the area. Story has it that this Indian was responsible for scalping a white farmer who was working in his field. The community hunted down the Indian a killed him. There has been documented investigations in this cemetery several times in just the past few years. Many uncertain images appear in pictures and audio recordings playback what sounds to be Indian chanting. The area residents discourage anyone from entering the cemetery after dark. This stems from several problems with cult activity in the years past. Many have stated that even on the hottest summer day once you enter the cast iron gates of the cemetery a cool breeze will follow you around. If you travel to the cemetery go to the farthest stone in the southeast corner of the cemetery and you will find the stone of the unnamed Indian.</div>`)[0];

Basically keeping all the money under their tight control. When the people of Oshkosh learned of the Paine center being built, they threatened the couple that if they ever moved into it, the people of Oshkosh would kill them. The couple feared the people of Oshkosh. And never did move it. In fact NO one has ever lived in the Paine Fine Art Center. Mr. Paine did pass on first, and Mrs. Paine did out live him. She donated their house to the city, with one stipulation, no children under 18 were allowed in it. She was never able to have children, and therefore resented children. Children are allowed in the center now, but Mrs. Paine is no longer alive. It's said that you can see the woman roaming the house during tours. The couple has also been seen together "enjoying" the house they dreamed of living in together.

Wolcott had his peculiarities: he often dressed in a formal smoking jacket complete with an ascot tie; he always dined in the lounge, always at the same seat. Unfortunately, Wolcott was stricken with cancer. Although treatments were painful he continued to dine at Brother Sebastian's, even while he was hospitalized. When Wolcott became so ill that he could no longer swallow solid food, the kitchen staff pureed his meals for him. At some point during this time Wolcott began draping a towel over his head while he was in public; but for some reason he was drawn to his favorite dining spot. Wolcott, it appears, felt so comfortable at Brother Sebastian's that he continues to frequent the restaurant even after his death. The last report of Wolcott's ghost occurred on the night of the restaurant’s grand re-opening. A woman seated in one of the back dining rooms complained that someone was staring at her and making her uncomfortable. The "Someone" to whom she referred was the face of an old man that the woman claimed was in the stones that make up the wall of the room. Two of the staff also witnessed, late one night after the restaurant was closed and all the doors were locked. They were the only people inside, they saw a swinging door at the rear of the bar open fully, stopped moving as if someone were walking through the threshold, and closed. Anyone who has been inside the building knows that a random wind breezing through to swing doors open and closed is unlikely: Just like the original building (before the 1995 fire), the new structure has no windows. Sometimes in restaurants an employee closes the establishment one night and opens the business the following morning. More than one server has stated that a candle that they knew was snuffed out the previous night was burning the next morning.</div>`)[0];

After a few seconds, the woman got up from the couch and disappeared into thin air! It is said that the coach was so upset by the event that he fainted.

Also, there are historical records that show that the County Courthouse is built on top of an ancient Indian burial mound, and that during the excavation for the courthouse basementseveral skeletons were unearthed, one of which was reported to have been approx. 7-8 feet tall and was buried in a seated position facing due north.</div>`)[0];

A voice told someone where a knife was located under a part of the floor that was used by the priest to kill someone. A tree right by the chapel was used to hang people. You can sometimes see figures hanging from the trees. Also when you look just right you can see a figure hanging inside the church itself. Also rumors of a man that walks a horse.

The city turned the cemetery into a park and couldn’t move all of the bodies because some of the bodies were marked with sticks and rocks and after the years passed, they were impossible to find. Late at night, you can see figures passing threw the park; one ghost sticks out among the rest. She is a lady who was on the Mormon Trail, her daughter died when they were staying at the camp and the girls mother was to devastated to go on and late at night in the winter, you can see the lady walking around the park crying.

The head custodian there has for many years told stories of the evening shift custodians and the basement. The building was at first built as Rockford Central High School near the turn of the 20th century. It has two buildings attached to it and an underground hallway that my mother (deceased) used as a student and they called that passage "rat alley". The hallway connected the first building to the second building. The basement of the "haunted" area used to be the "shop" area and housed small machines for the male students to practice machine skills. It is not clear what happened down there, but the custodians DON'T like to go down there at night, the lights will turn on after being turned OFF. Many a morning the head custodian will arrive for his day shift and find all the lights on in the basement. The lights seem to have a will of their own. A former secretarythought it was strange to hear hear grown men sound afraid of the basement. They hear noises down there, voices, all kinds of things.</div>`)[0];
